Description: A toolkit of tidy data manipulation verbs with `data.table` as the backend (partly) via `maditr`.
  Combines the merits of syntax elegance from `dplyr` and computing performance from `data.table`, 
  `tidydt` intends to provide users with state-of-the-art data manipulation tools with least pain.
  This package is inspired by `maditr`, but follows a different philosophy of design, 
  such as prohibiting in place replacement and used a "_dt" suffix API.
  Also, `tidydt` would introduce more tidy data verbs from other packages,
  including but not limit to `tidyverse` and `data.table`.
