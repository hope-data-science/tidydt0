1. Use new API for `rename_dt`, more like the `rename` in `dplyr`.
2. Change some API name, e.g. `topn_dt` to `top_n_dt`.
3. Add functions to deal with missing values(`replace_na_dt`,`drop_na_dt`).
4. Change the `on_attach.R` file to change the hints.
5. Add `pull_dt`, which I use a lot and so may many others.
6. Add `mutate_when` for another advanced `case_when` utility.
